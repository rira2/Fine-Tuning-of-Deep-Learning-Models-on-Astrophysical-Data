# Fine-Tuning-of-Deep-Learning-Models-on-Astrophysical-Data

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Classified spiral vs elliptical galaxies using the Galaxy Zoo dataset.
Used transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs and applied LoRA for efficient fine-tuning.
ðŸ§  Models Used
ResNet-50 (baseline evaluation)
MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 (fine-tuned + LoRA)
ðŸ›  Techniques
Transfer learning and fine-tuning
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
Image preprocessing, class balancing, augmentation
Evaluation via accuracy
ðŸ“ˆ Results
Accuracy improved significantly with fine-tuning
LoRA achieved similar results with fewer trainable parameters
